We are developing a multiplayer typing speed–based F1 car racing game where 2 to 4 players can join a room using a QR code or lobby code. Once all players have joined, a typing test begins. Each player’s typing speed determines the speed of their F1 car, which moves horizontally in a 2D race displayed on a central screen. The game runs on a local server hosted on the developer’s laptop, handling both the backend and frontend, and provides a fun, competitive way to showcase real-time typing performance.
